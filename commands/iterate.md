description: "Execute a single Ralph loop iteration - complete one work unit from tasks.md with proper commits and progress tracking"

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Scope Constraint

**CRITICAL**: Complete AT MOST ONE user story in this iteration.

- If you cannot complete an entire user story, complete as many tasks as you can
- Partial progress is fine -- uncompleted tasks will be handled in subsequent iterations
- DO NOT start a second user story even if you have time remaining
- This prevents context rot and keeps changes reviewable

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run the prerequisite check script from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax appropriate to your shell.

   ```bash
   .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
   ```

   ```powershell
   .specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks
   ```

2. **Read context first**:
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/ralph-memory.md` FIRST -- it is the primary durable source for codebase patterns, decisions, gotchas, reusable commands, failed approaches, and the current handoff
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md` -- understand task structure and identify next incomplete user story
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md` for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read `FEATURE_DIR/data-model.md` for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read `FEATURE_DIR/contracts/` for API specifications
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read `FEATURE_DIR/research.md` for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read only the recent relevant entries in `FEATURE_DIR/progress.md` for optional audit context; never use it as the primary memory bridge

3. **Identify scope**:
   - Find the FIRST user story section with incomplete tasks (`- [ ]`)
   - Work ONLY on tasks within that single user story
   - Example: If "US-001: Initialize Ralph Command" has incomplete tasks, work only on US-001

4. **Implement and validate tasks**:
   - Complete tasks in dependency order (non-[P] before parallel [P] where noted)
   - Follow TDD when appropriate: write tests first, then implementation
   - Run quality checks after each task (typecheck, lint, test as appropriate)
   - Do not change task state until the corresponding substantive result passes its quality checks

5. **Persist the iteration outcome before any commit**:
   - When ALL tasks in the selected user story are substantively complete and validated:
     1. Mark the completed tasks by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in `tasks.md`
     2. Preserve and compact durable discoveries in `ralph-memory.md`; replace `Current Handoff` with only the information needed by the next iteration
     3. If no task remains anywhere in `tasks.md`, replace the handoff content with exactly `- Feature complete; no handoff required.`
     4. Append the Progress Report below with `**Commit**: This work-unit commit`
     5. Stage substantive files together with `tasks.md`, `ralph-memory.md`, and `progress.md`
   - When the selected work unit fails, produces no work, or remains partial:
     - Do not create a commit
     - Leave `HEAD` unchanged
     - Leave `tasks.md` byte-for-byte unchanged for a failed or no-work attempt; a validated partial result may mark only its completed tasks
     - Preserve useful failure knowledge in `ralph-memory.md` and append the Progress Report with `**Commit**: No commit - no completed work unit`
     - Leave those state changes uncommitted so the next substantive work-unit commit includes them

6. **Create one substantive commit only after coordinated persistence**:
   - Before creating the commit, resolve the effective commit policy from `.specify/extensions/ralph/ralph-config.yml` (or `.local.yml` override):
     - If the `commit` block is **absent**, use legacy format (default).
     - If `commit.style` is present but unsupported, **stop immediately** with a clear configuration error — do not create a commit.
     - If `commit.style` is `legacy` (or absent), use: `feat(<feature-name>): <user story title>`
     - If `commit.style` is `conventional`, use: `feat(<scope>): <user story title>` where `<scope>` defaults to `ralph` when `commit.scope` is not set.
     - If `commit.issue: auto` is set, infer an issue number from a leading numeric branch prefix (e.g. `069-...` → `#69`) and append ` #<N>` when inference succeeds; omit the suffix silently when no numeric prefix exists.
   - When ALL tasks in the selected user story are complete (`[x]`), create exactly one commit using the resolved subject:

     ```sh
     git add -A
     git commit -m "<resolved commit subject>"
     ```

   - Legacy example (no config): `git commit -m "feat(001-ralph-loop-implement): US-001 Initialize Ralph Command"`
   - Legacy with issue: `git commit -m "feat(069-ctx-list-filter): US-001 Initialize Ralph Command #69"`
   - Conventional example: `git commit -m "feat(ralph): US-001 Initialize Ralph Command"`
   - Conventional with issue: `git commit -m "feat(myapp): US-001 Initialize Ralph Command #42"`
   - Never create a commit containing only `tasks.md`, `ralph-memory.md`, and/or `progress.md`
   - Never amend or create a follow-up bookkeeping commit to insert a commit hash into the audit log
   - After committing, leave no bookkeeping change outside the commit

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to FEATURE_DIR/progress.md:

```markdown
---
## Iteration [N] - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Work Unit**: [US-XXX title or failed/partial description]
**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Task ID: description
**Tasks Remaining in Work Unit**: [count or description]
**Commit**: [This work-unit commit | No commit - no completed work unit]
**Files Changed**:
- path/to/file.ext
**Learnings**:
- [concise audit note; put durable detail in ralph-memory.md]
---
```

Append the new record after every existing byte in `progress.md`. Do not reorganize or rewrite historical entries, including legacy `Codebase Patterns` content.

## Stop Conditions

Output the completion signal only after the final substantive work-unit transaction has
passed every quality check and all of these statements are true:

- Every task in `tasks.md` is complete (`[x]`)
- `ralph-memory.md` is structurally valid
- `Current Handoff` contains exactly one entry and no other content: `- Feature complete; no handoff required.`
- The final substantive commit includes the implementation plus `tasks.md`, `ralph-memory.md`, and `progress.md`
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all` succeeds and emits no lines

Then output the following as the final line of your response, alone on its own line with
no other text or backticks around it:

```text
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

This signals the ralph loop orchestrator to terminate successfully. The orchestrator only
recognizes the token when it stands alone on a line.

If any completion condition fails—including remaining tasks, a failed quality check, an
invalid or stale handoff, an incomplete commit, or a dirty path—end your response normally
and DO NOT write the token anywhere in your response. Do not mention the token in prose.
The orchestrator independently validates the same conditions and will reject a premature
signal rather than allowing it to override a failed iteration or inconsistent state.

## Quality Gates

- ALL changes must pass quality checks before marking tasks complete
- DO NOT commit broken code
- Follow existing code patterns and decisions from `ralph-memory.md`
- Reference plan.md for architecture decisions
- Run tests if they exist before committing

## Code Style

Follow the patterns established in the codebase:

- Check existing files for naming conventions
- Match indentation and formatting styles
- Use the same import/module patterns
- Follow any linting rules configured in the project

## Error Handling

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| User story unclear | Ask for clarification in progress entry, mark tasks as blocked |
| Tests fail | Report failure, do not mark task complete, no commit |
| Cannot complete story | Persist useful memory/audit context, leave `HEAD` unchanged, and make no commit |
| All tasks done | Persist the terminal handoff, create the coordinated final substantive commit, verify the clean completion gate, then output the completion signal |
| Dependencies missing | Note in progress file, skip to next available task |
