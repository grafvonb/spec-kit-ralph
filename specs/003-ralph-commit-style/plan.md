# Implementation Plan: Configurable Ralph Commit Style

**Branch**: `003-ralph-commit-style` | **Date**: 2026-07-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/003-ralph-commit-style/spec.md`

## Summary

Add an optional Ralph commit policy that preserves the legacy work-unit commit subject `feat(<feature-name>): <work-unit title>` by default, supports an opt-in conventional format with configurable scope and default scope `ralph`, and appends an inferred GitHub issue reference when requested. The commit policy is valid only when expressed as a nested `commit:` block in `.specify/extensions/ralph/ralph-config.yml`; flattened keys are invalid. The design resolves commit policy consistently before agent execution, updates the public iterate/config contracts, and validates the behavior through mirrored Bash and PowerShell regression coverage plus documentation updates.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Bash 3.2+; Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+; Markdown; YAML 1.2-compatible configuration

**Primary Dependencies**: Git CLI; standard Bash utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `mktemp`, `realpath`); PowerShell/.NET file and process APIs; existing Spec Kit integration metadata and command registration

**Storage**: Git-tracked extension source files plus project-level Ralph configuration at `.specify/extensions/ralph/ralph-config.yml`

**Testing**: Existing dependency-free Bash regression harness, PowerShell assertion harness, parser validation, and temporary-Git-repository scenarios

**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux via Bash and Windows via PowerShell, with equivalent work-unit commit behavior across supported agent CLIs

**Project Type**: Spec Kit extension composed of Markdown command contracts, cross-platform orchestration scripts, configuration templates, and regression tests

**Performance Goals**: Commit policy resolution adds only bounded local config and branch-name parsing before a completed work-unit commit; no extra agent iteration or network dependency is introduced

**Constraints**: Preserve current behavior exactly when commit config is absent; reject unsupported `commit.style` values clearly and reject flattened commit-policy keys outside the nested `commit:` block; support `issue: auto` without failing when no issue prefix exists; avoid adding a YAML parser dependency; maintain Bash/PowerShell parity; keep the change extension-local and documentation-complete

**Scale/Scope**: One public config surface, one public iterate-command contract, two orchestration scripts, two regression suites, one config template, README guidance, and example/fixture updates for exact legacy and conventional commit outputs

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-checked after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Research Gate

| Principle / Gate | Status | Planning Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| I. Extension-First Architecture | PASS | All changes stay within the extension's commands, scripts, config template, tests, and docs; no Spec Kit core modification is needed. |
| II. Context Isolation | PASS | The feature changes commit-subject policy only; it does not alter Ralph's fresh-process iteration model or memory contract. |
| III. Spec-Kit Compatibility | PASS | The config remains optional and backward-compatible; no new command, hook, schema, or installation requirement is introduced. |
| IV. Progress Persistence | PASS | Commit subject formatting does not change task, memory, or progress persistence rules. |
| V. Agent Agnosticism | PASS | Commit policy is defined through extension config and shared orchestration behavior rather than a single agent-specific implementation. |
| VI. Graceful Termination | PASS | Unsupported config becomes an explicit, non-success validation outcome instead of a silent fallback. |
| Manifest Gate | PASS | Existing command/config registration remains sufficient; only referenced files and docs change. |
| Script Gate | PENDING | Bash and PowerShell must resolve and validate commit policy identically. |
| Integration Gate | PENDING | Validation must cover the installed extension path and active project config behavior. |
| Documentation Gate | PENDING | README and config template must document the new commit options and examples. |
| Compatibility Gate | PENDING | Regression validation must show existing projects without commit config remain unchanged. |

**Gate Result**: PASS for planning. No constitution amendment or exception is required.

### Post-Design Re-evaluation

| Principle / Gate | Status | Design Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| I. Extension-First Architecture | PASS | The design is captured in [commit-config-schema.md](contracts/commit-config-schema.md) and [work-unit-commit-format.md](contracts/work-unit-commit-format.md), both extension-local artifacts. |
| II. Context Isolation | PASS | The resolved commit policy is an on-disk/config-derived input to each fresh iteration and does not depend on reused in-memory state. |
| III. Spec-Kit Compatibility | PASS | [research.md](research.md) keeps the config optional and avoids any core/runtime dependency expansion. |
| IV. Progress Persistence | PASS | [work-unit-commit-format.md](contracts/work-unit-commit-format.md) changes only commit-subject construction, not the coordinated persistence contract. |
| V. Agent Agnosticism | PASS | The plan resolves policy in mirrored orchestrators and exposes one shared contract to Copilot, Codex, and Claude paths. |
| VI. Graceful Termination | PASS | Invalid present config is a deterministic preflight failure with no silent fallback and no history mutation. |
| Script Gate | PASS BY DESIGN | The same config-resolution, issue-inference, and validation scenarios are planned for both scripts and both regression suites. |
| Integration / Documentation / Compatibility Gates | PENDING IMPLEMENTATION | [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) defines the validation evidence required to close them. |

No constitution violation or exception remains after design.

```

**Structure Decision**: Extend the existing flat extension layout. Commit policy resolution and validation live in the mirrored orchestrator scripts; agent-facing commit instructions stay in `commands/iterate.md`; the project-visible configuration surface remains `ralph-config.template.yml`; regression coverage and fixtures stay in the existing cross-platform suites.
